Step 1:   First install Pip installer you don't have in your redhat 6.4/7.1

[root@desktop83 ~]# yum  install python-pip

then Install ansible :

[root@desktop83 ~]# pip  install  ansible

After Installation  process this operation  you can check there will be  /etc/ansible directory

OR :

You can use Yum installer if you have repopath setup already.


 For Redhat 6.4 and later
==================

[root@desktop57 ~]# rpm -ivh  http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

[root@desktop57 ~]#  yum   install  ansible

 For Redhat 7.1 and Later

[root@desktop57 ~]# rpm -iUvh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm

[root@desktop57 ~]#  cd /etc/yum.repos.d

[root@desktop57 yum.repos.d]# cat  live.repo 
[aa]
baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7.2.1511/os/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0

[bb]
baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7.2.1511/extras/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0




[root@desktop57 ~]#  yum   install  ansible
root@ashulinux:/etc/ansible# cd  /etc/ansible/
root@ashulinux:/etc/ansible# ls
hosts

Step 2:  Managing  Servers

Ansible was designed to managed multiple servers from a single system by using SSH

Important :

Here We have  three  machine  one is Ansible  installed  and other two are the targets where we want to perform operation

Ansible Installed machine is :   192.168.100.104


Target1 --   192.168.100.9
target2 --   192.168.100.10 


Note:   Setup and  and share ssh-keys  from  Ansible machine to target

i)  Generating  ssh-keys

 [root@hmaster ~]# ssh-keygen 
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
fe:4c:85:36:03:b8:3a:35:35:ec:70:f0:28:bb:ee:a1 root@hmaster.example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|      .          |
|       *         |
|    . + B        |
|     o * o .     |
|    . + S = .    |
|     + o . +     |
|    =   . .      |
|   o o   +       |
|  E.o     o      |
+-----------------+

ii)  share keys to both the targets machine 

[root@hmaster ~]# ssh-copy-id   192.168.100.9
[root@hmaster ~]# ssh-copy-id   192.168.100.10



Now go to Ansible machine and configure the hosts file

iii)   make a backup of host file

root@ashulinux:~# cp  /etc/ansible/hosts    /etc/ansible/hosts.backup

iv)  Now edit this file and specify the targets IPS

Important:   File  /etc/ansible/hosts    also known as inventory file


root@ashulinux:~# vim  /etc/ansible/hosts

This will look like this

root@ashulinux:~# cat  /etc/ansible/hosts
[testing]
192.168.100.9
192.168.100.10
