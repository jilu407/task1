task1 :


here i am going  to Use Ansible Configuration Management tooL  for automating 
3-tier job 

I have Learn Something About Ansible which is discuss below :

Ansible is  a configuration  management and provisioning tooL similar to Chef , Puppet and Salt stack.
Ansible Tasks are idempotent. Without a lot of extra coding, bash scripts are usually not safety run again and again. Ansible uses "Facts", which is system and environment information it gathers ("context") before running Tasks.
Ansible uses these facts to check state and see if it needs to change anything in order to get the desired outcome. This makes it safe to run Ansible Tasks against a server over and over again.
